# React Native Dictionary App

This project is meant to be a starter guide to learning React Native** while also practicing working with external APIs

## Who is this for?

This project is designed for recent graduates or students who are already familiar with **React** and comfortable working with JavaScript.

You will also notice this project uses Axios, if you are not familiar with it you can easily replace the logic with a normal fetch.

## Some theory before start

React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook/Meta for building cross-platform mobile applications. It allows developers to write code in JavaScript and create native-like apps for iOS and Android platforms. 

When creating a React or Vanilla JS project, you can see the product of your code in the browser, in this case, things are different - as React Native develops a mobile app, usually you will need to setup Android Studio or Xcode tools to run the code in a iPhone or android emulators.

However fear not, this project uses (React Native Expo)[https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup], so you will be able to run your code in your own mobile phone as we will explain in the following section.

## Getting started

Once you cloned the repository on your own machine

`cd react-native-dictionary-app`

Run in the terminal

`yarn expo start`

You will see a QR code, download the Expo Go app in your own mobile device to scan it and so see your dictionary app!
