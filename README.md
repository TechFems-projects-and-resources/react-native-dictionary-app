## Some theory before start

React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook/Meta for building cross-platform mobile applications. It allows developers to write code in JavaScript and create native-like apps for iOS and Android platforms. 

When creating a React or Vanilla JS project, you can see the product of your code in the browser, in this case, things are different - as React Native develops a mobile app, usually you will need to setup Android Studio or Xcode tools to run the code in a iPhone or android emulators.

However fear not, this project uses (React Native Expo)[https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup].
